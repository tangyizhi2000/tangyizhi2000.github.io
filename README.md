### 09/06/2023 (day1) ###
- Duration: 3.5h

- Bankroll:
	- CoinPoker: +4.35
	- PokerStarUSNJ: -14.21
	- Total: -9.86

Hands:

- 
	1. A9suited, Middle Position Open. Villain in button calls.
	1. 739 rainball, bet 1/3, villain calls.
	1. T on the turn, 2 diamonds, bet 1/2, villain calls.
	1. Q of diamond on the river, 3 diamonds, check; villain bets full pot, I fold.
	1. Thoughts: probably don't have a backdoor flush with the only possible being A7 and A3 of diamond. Could have two pairs like Qx and T9; could have set 77s, 33s, 99s, TTs (consider the fact that this game is really under 3-bet); could have straigt like 68 and even 8J type of hands; folded since couldn't find a lot of bluffs, bluffs I can think of is 78 and 89; large river bet when I bet 1/2 on the turn is really under bluffed.
-
	1. JKoff, Villain late position open, I am in button call.
	1. K32, 3 and 2 are diamond. Villain bets full pot, I call.
	1. Q on the turn, still 2 diamonds. Villain bets full pot, I call.
	1. 3 on the river, still 2 diamonds. Villain bets full pot, I call. Villain shows 32 suited rivered full house.
	1. Thoughts: A relatively dry board, the total number of combos that can triple barrel is KQ 6 combos + AK 8 combos + AA 6 combos + KK 1 combos = 21 combos. Villain bluffs can contain all suited diamonds connectors and maybe 1 gapper, approximately 20 combos, and some random bluffs. However, all-in bluffs and triple barrel bluffs are so rare in this stake level; Next time, call when at least beats some value hands of the triple-barreling villain.

### 09/12/2023 (day2) ###
- Duration: 3h

- Bankroll:
	- CoinPoker: +42.9
	- PokerStarUSNJ: -0.00
	- Total: +42.9

Hands:

- 
	1. Poket 33, Button. Villain mid position open, I call. Heads up.
	1. Flop Q83, Q3 diamonds, hit set. Villain check, I bet for 1/2 pot; villain check-raise me 5 times, huge raise. I call.
	1. Turn K, still 2 diamonds. Villain bet 3/4 pot, I call.
	1. River 4, still 2 diamonds. Villain goes All-in. I call. Villain got AA, I won.
	1. Thoughts: Villain play really bad, especially the river bet. Pocket Aces does not have triple barrel value, since I don't have AK in my range. I have a lot of QK which beats pocket aces, and I have a lot of AQ that cannot call a large river bet. I won't have KT, KJ since these two hands will not have called a large flop check-raise. Villain should let me bluff with flush draws. For myself, I played good that I didn't re-raise the flop or the turn. A re-raise of a 5 times check raise will simply be too strong, and we want Villain to keep bluffing. From my perspective, Villain looks like a flush-draw when he check-raise large on the flop, or QK when he bets large on the turn. Good thing for me, easy call on the river since river is clean, no flush/straight.

### 09/14/2023 (day4) ###
- Duration: 4h

- Bankroll:
	- CoinPoker: +40.00
	- PokerStarUSNJ: +4.00
	- Total: +44.00

Hands:

-
	1. A8 suited on the button. Villain opens in early position. I call.
	1. Flop 89T, two spades. Villain c-bet half pot, I call.
	1. Turn 6, no flush completed. Villain bet half pot, I call.
	1. River 2, a brick. Villain bet half pot, I call. Villain turns over A7, a straight. I lose.
	1. Thoughts: the reason why I call the river bet is that, in my range, I have more 7 than Villain. Villain's strong holdings such as an over pair, two pairs, or even set will almost always check when there is 4 to a straight. I have A8, which also blocks A7, and 87.

### 09/15/2023 (day5) ###
- Duration: 1h

- Bankroll:
	- CoinPoker: +22.00
	- PokerStarUSNJ: +0.00
	- Total: +22.00

Hands:

-
	1. TJ off suit on the button. Villain limps, I limp (suited connectors do well in multi-way pot). Three people to a flop.
	1. Flop 789 all hearts; we flopped straight, but we don't hold a heart. Villain leads half-pot, I call. Heads up to a turn.
	1. Turn 3 of heart, an action killer. Villain leads 1/3 pot, I call.
	1. River 8, a pair on the board. Villain checks, I check. Villain got 79 and flopped two pairs.
	1. Thoughts: initial thoughts are Villain might have the A of heart and bluffing here. So only called to keep bluffs in. I do not think Villain have a set (he limped in), but Villain do have a lot of two pairs in his range. The takeaway here is that, in Villain's range there are a lot of made hands more than drawing hand. So we could raise here, since there might be a lot of action-killers on the turn/river. Raising also gives A of heart drawing hand a bad pot odds, but opponent might call since he might think another Ace is an out for him.
-
	1. QQ in small blind. Villain in UTG raises. I 3-bet, he calls my 3-bet.
	1. Flop 457 two diamonds. Relatively wet board. I check to him, he checks back.
	1. Turn T. Two clubs, two diamonds. I bet less than half pot. He  calls.
	1. River 5, a pair on the board. All draws break, I check, he bets half-pot, I call. Villain got JJ.
	1. Thoughts: Maybe I should bet the flop, given such a wet board. However, when Villain checks back, his drawing hands possibility decreases (he is relativley aggressive). I should bet turn AND RIVER (river bet large) to target his JJ, 99, AT type of hands. The question is, given the timeline, should I check raise on the river? When Villain leads half pot, his range narrows down further that I doubt he would do this with 99, AT, leaving JJ the only value hand that I can beat. So just calling the half-pot river bet is good.
-
	1. KK in bit blind. Villain in UTG raises. I 3-bet, he calls my 3-bet.
	1. Flop 568, two spades. I bet half-pot, Villain calls.
	1. Turn 5, three spades, a pair on the board. I check, Villain bets half-pot. I call.
	1. River another 5, giving me full house. I bet pot, Villain fold.
	1. Thoughts: flop bet is good since it is such a wet board. For Turn, flush draw gets there. I wanted to fold KK without a spade in hand but I also think Villain could protection-bet here with TT, JJ, and QQ; denying my equity if I have an Ace of spade. So I called. The rivered full house I bet large to target all TT, JJ and QQ type of hands.
