Hands:

- 
	1. A9suited, Middle Position Open. Villain in button calls.
	1. 739 rainball, bet 1/3, villain calls.
	1. T on the turn, 2 diamonds, bet 1/2, villain calls.
	1. Q of diamond on the river, 3 diamonds, check; villain bets full pot, I fold.
	1. Thoughts: probably don't have a backdoor flush with the only possible A7 of diamond. Could have two pairs like Qx and T9; could have set 77s, 33s, 99s, TTs (consider the fact that this game is really under 3-bet); could have straigt like 68 and even 8J type of hands; folded since couldn't find a lot of bluffs, and large river bet when I bet 1/2 on the turn is really under bluffed.
