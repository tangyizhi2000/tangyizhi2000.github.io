Duration: 3.5h

Bankroll:
	- CoinPoker: +4.35
	- PokerStarUSNJ: -14.21
	- Total: -9.86

Hands:

- 
	1. A9suited, Middle Position Open. Villain in button calls.
	1. 739 rainball, bet 1/3, villain calls.
	1. T on the turn, 2 diamonds, bet 1/2, villain calls.
	1. Q of diamond on the river, 3 diamonds, check; villain bets full pot, I fold.
	1. Thoughts: probably don't have a backdoor flush with the only possible being A7 and A3 of diamond. Could have two pairs like Qx and T9; could have set 77s, 33s, 99s, TTs (consider the fact that this game is really under 3-bet); could have straigt like 68 and even 8J type of hands; folded since couldn't find a lot of bluffs, bluffs I can think of is 78 and 89; large river bet when I bet 1/2 on the turn is really under bluffed.
-
	1. JKoff, Villain late position open, I am in button call.
	1. K32, 3 and 2 are diamond. Villain bets full pot, I call.
	1. Q on the turn, still 2 diamonds. Villain bets full pot, I call.
	1. 3 on the river, still 2 diamonds. Villain bets full pot, I call. Villain shows 32 suited rivered full house.
	1. Thoughts: A relatively dry board, the total number of combos that can triple barrel is KQ 6 combos + AK 8 combos + AA 6 combos + KK 1 combos = 21 combos. Villain bluffs can contain all suited diamonds connectors and maybe 1 gapper, approximately 20 combos, and some random bluffs. However, all-in bluffs and triple barrel bluffs are so rare in this stake level; Next time, call when at least beats some value hands of the triple-barreling villain.
